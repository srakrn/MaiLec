# MaiLec - A Simple Markdown Viewer

MaiLec (My auto infamous Lecture viewer -- A backronym from "Not Small" in Thai language) is a tiny Markdown viewer, based on PHP.

As I write my lecture notes in Markdown, I found writing a small viewer for PHP makes sharing them to my friends much easier. 

## Usage

You should have your Apache properly set up, along with `mod_rewrite` enabled and `AllowOverride All` for `.htaccess`..

Store any Markdown files in this directory, and that's all.
